HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM USING IOT


ABSTRACT:
This project will discuss health services in the field of diagnostic tools and life support systems in the form of photoplethysmography. We designed a system capable of providing heart pumping activity information through a phenomenon known as photoelectric so the user's health condition. We collect the data pulse using a heart rate sensor (fingertip sensor). This system works to retrieve data from the bloodstream on the index finger and for the simulation the data is retrieved from the sensor through a test pin giving arbitrary values.

INTRODUCTION:
The diagnostic tool measuring heart rate is a medical device that will be used to help nurses and very useful to know the state of the patient's condition. The tool further helps in remote monitoring of a patient through a Telegram bot. The principle of this diagnostic tool is to count the number of heartbeats in minutes and also provide the oxygen level. The Telegram bot also updates the nurses regarding the state of the patients when not in vicinity. Then from the heart beat count will be determined whether the patient is in normal condition or not. Usually, people who have arrhythmia abnormalities of heart disease, specific values will deviate from the range of 60-100 BPM. Monitoring heart rate is very important for athletes, patients as it determines the condition of the heart (just heart rate). There are many ways to measure heart rate and the most precise one is using an Electrocardiography but the easier way to monitor the heart rate is to use a Heartbeat Sensor. It comes in different shapes and sizes and allows an instant way to measure the heartbeat.
Heartbeat Sensors are available in Wrist Watches (Smart Watches), Smart Phones, chest straps, etc. The heartbeat is measured in beats per minute or bpm, which indicates the number of times the heart is contracting or expanding in a minute.
